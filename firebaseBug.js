The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email or password is incorrect or if there is a network issue.  This can lead to a crash if not handled properly.  Additionally, attempting to access data from Firebase Realtime Database before the authentication process is complete can result in unexpected behavior, since the user might not have the proper permissions.
